# Screen Time Analysis 

## Overview

The "Screen Time Analysis using Python" project focuses on analyzing screen time patterns by examining usage, notifications, and app-switching behaviors. By processing a dataset containing app details and screen time metrics, this project showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding device usage habits.

## Background

Screen time analysis aims to provide insights into user behavior and app usage patterns. This project utilizes Python to analyze and visualize screen time data, shedding light on the relationship between app usage, notifications, and user interactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- Date of usage
- App usage details
- Number of notifications
- Number of times apps were opened

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data analysis, visualization, and insights.
- **Data:** Contains the screen time dataset used in the analysis.
- **Images:** Stores images, plots, and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md:** Project documentation and overview.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset is imported using pandas, and basic data cleaning and inspection are performed to ensure data quality.

## Screen Time Metrics

- Usage: Visualizations are created to showcase the usage of different apps over time.
- Notifications: Analysis is done on the number of notifications from various apps and their impact on usage.
- Times Opened: Insights are derived from the frequency of app openings.

## App Usage Analysis

The project provides visual reports on app usage, indicating which apps are most frequently used.

## App Switching Patterns

Patterns of app switching are examined, giving an understanding of user behavior when transitioning between apps.

## Results

The project's analyses and visualizations provide insights into screen time behaviors, including app usage, notifications, and app switching patterns.
